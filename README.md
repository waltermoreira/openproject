# OpenProject Deploy

Recipes and examples for deploying OpenProject using Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, etc.

This is a light modification to the original recipe to include a reverse proxy (Traefik) and a sample hosted besides the OpenProject app. The goal is to have a single docker-compose file that can deploy OpenProject together with other components.
