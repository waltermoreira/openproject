# Jobber

See repository at: https://github.com/dshearer/jobber
See official image at: https://hub.docker.com/_/jobber

We build our own derived image because we want to add `httpie`.


## Configuration

Define your jobs following `jobber` config structure and adding them to the
value `jobs`:

    jobs: |
      MyJob:
        cmd: ...
        time: ...
